I have created two tables: tv_summary and brand_details.
The tv_summary table contains the following columns: price, brand, operating_system, size, and rating.
The brand_details table includes information such as brand and country.

I used the INSERT statement to add data into the tables and the UPDATE statement to modify existing records.
To analyze the data, I applied the GROUP BY and COUNT() functions to group records and count entries, and used the ORDER BY clause to sort the results by brand name.
The SUM() function was used to calculate the total amount (e.g., total price).

I performed an INNER JOIN and a FINAL JOIN to combine data from both tables based on the brand column, allowing me to integrate brand-specific details with TV specifications.
